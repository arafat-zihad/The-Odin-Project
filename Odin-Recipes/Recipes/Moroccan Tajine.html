    <p>Tajines are simply delicious but in the most cases they're made with meat.
        Well, this one isn't and is just as falvourfull as the others.
        
        Unfortunately you need a tajine to make a tajine. And to heat up your tajine
        you will also need a gas stove. I guess there are also other options but this is
        the way I prepared my Tajine in Morocco.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Potatoes</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First dice the onion and slice the vegetables.</li>
        <li>Add some oil to the bottom of the tajine but dn't cook it yet.</li>
        <li>Now you have to build a kind of tent with the vegetables over the tomatoes.</li>
    </ol>
